=======

My personal C++ library. It contains replacements for many of the the Standard Template Library containers, as well as some data structures and algorithms of my own design (though I doubt any of them are truly original). I place a strong emphasis on well-written and well-documented code, though the oldest classes now date back nearly a decade and deserve a modern touch-up.

Many classes require C++11 features to build. The included Makefile should be sufficient, provided you have gcc >= 4.7 installed (and the g++ command is on your path).
